Using a simple naive implementation of is_prime (as below) without caching
would take too long. Simply swapping this out for the Sieve of Eratosthenes
works.

A followup question: How do we know there are no more
bidirectionally-truncatable primes?

Naive implementation of is_prime:

    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for m in range(2, n):
            if n % m == 0:
                return False
        return True
