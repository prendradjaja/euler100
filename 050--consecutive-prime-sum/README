JavaScript solution takes 2 min (1 second for n = 100 thousand)

Python is probably slower

Is there a better algorithm? I suppose instead of iterating over (start, stop) pairs blindly, I could do in order of increasing length (and whenever I find something for a given length, move on to the next length)

That's all I can think of in terms of optimizations, though.

Try this in C++?

---

update: "optimization" does not actually help significantly in terms of
runtime, because most of the runtime is spent on the longer lengths (which
have more iterations), which do not have any valid consecutive sums, so cannot
break early

but on the other hand, we get the answer very quickly due to the order we do
things in -- it just takes a long time to confirm it's definitely the answer

but but: if i ever needed to do this for a larger input, i THINK i would bet a
lot of money that once the program "hung" the last part printed was the
correct answer -- but i'm too sleepy to be sure my reasoning was right --
write this out later maybe
