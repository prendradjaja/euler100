JavaScript solution takes 2 min (1 second for n = 100 thousand)

Python is probably slower

Is there a better algorithm? I suppose instead of iterating over (start, stop) pairs blindly, I could do in order of increasing length (and whenever I find something for a given length, move on to the next length)

That's all I can think of in terms of optimizations, though.

Try this in C++?
